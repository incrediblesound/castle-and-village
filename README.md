Castle and Village
==================

Castle and Village is a text-based object-oriented single-page multi-hyphen fantasy strategy game. Other than feeding my desire to make fantasy games, this project is an experiment to see what can be done with OOP and event systems. If I get around to it I might try removing jQuery and make it entirely native JS.
